// How will we get the data for each photo to fill out the model?
// The list of photos is rendered in the PhotoList component, so this 
// is the logical place for the modal to openâ€”and for us to access the 
// individual photo data. We'll establish the Photolist as the parent 
// component and the Modal as the child component, because the Modal is 
// located in PhotoList. PhotoList also plays a major role in activating 
// the modal, but we we'll discuss that more later.
// Destructure props received from PhotoList 
// into currentPhoto in the Modal parameter.
function Modal({ currentPhoto, onClose }) {
    // Destructure props received from PhotoList 
    // into currentPhoto in the Modal parameter.
    // Then destructure currentPhoto properties into constants to 
    // assign their values into the modal
