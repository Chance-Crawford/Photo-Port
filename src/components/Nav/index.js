    // the tab on the browser to reflect the user's category selection. 
    // This will improve the user experience by providing the user with 
    // feedback from the website.
    //  If we simply reassign document.title = currentCategory, we'll 
    // change the value of document.title. But will this cause a 
    // re-render of the component? Judging by what we experienced 
    // earlier in this lessonâ€”no, it won't. We must use a hook to trigger a 
    // re-render on a variable value change.
    // we will introduce a new Hook called useEffect. The main difference 
    // between useEffect and useState is that useEffect is an API that 
    // reflects the lifecycle methods of the component, such as when the 
    // component mounts, unmounts, or updates.
    // Here useEffect waits for an update to currentCategory, when it changes,
    // the function to change the document.title will trigger.
    // The second argument directs the hook to re-render the component 
    // on changes to the value of this state. In other words, if 
    // currentCategory changes now, the component will re-render so that 
    // the change in document.title will be visible to the user.
    useEffect(() => {
        document.title = capitalizeFirstLetter(currentCategory.name);
